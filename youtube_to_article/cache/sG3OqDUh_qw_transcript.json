  "transcript": "We're being robbed! Look! This is a reconstructed image of a young man who had no name. His identity, a mystery that police believed impossible to solve. Tentgirl.com is a domain that 30 years ago began displaying this eerie sketch of a woman. Three words, white, female, bone. When authorities arrived at the stripping pit to investigate. Before investments, he'd been arriving at an orphanage. Unclip may have been the remains of right and wrong. We did ask you so many questions. Why didn't you come? But we aren't the only ones. We did some digging and, as it turns out, countless other YouTube channels are being stolen from. And it's the perfect crime, which is why nobody is talking about it. Until now. One day, one of our producers stumbled upon an article from Medium. How reddit cracked a 20-year-old case that police called Impossible. It looked familiar. That title was exactly the same as our own video on the same case. A young man found dead. Nicknamed the Grateful Doe due to his grateful dead t-shirt and ticket steps. His identity was discovered thanks to the hard work of reddit and other online communities, which we outlined in our video. But when he clicked the link, it wasn't just the title that was the same. The entire article was copied word-for-word from the video originally written by one of our writers. The very producer and writer of this video, in fact. We're not given credit in this article, nor the other 17 Bruce scripts that have been stolen and published on Medium.com. And it's frustrating because we're all proud of our videos. And they take a lot of work to make. First, the producers need to find a unique topic, or at least one that we could approach from a different angle. Maybe a story that needs more eyes on it, for example. And that requires a lot of initial research from trusted primary sources. Then comes the writing. First, an outline is put together to ensure that we present the story in the most engaging and accurate way possible. Then, one of our talented writers does a deeper dive into the research and writes the script without using AI. And after feedback, it's sent off to our voice artist to record. By me. Hi. You know, some people think I use AI because I have a weird cadence and I mispronounce words sometimes. Nope. That's just how I am. Then our extremely skilled editors put it all together without using anything generated by AI. Sound, music, stock footage, maps, photos, videos, killer 3D scenes, and then they animate my body. Feedback, final checks, thumbnail, title, description, then it's uploaded. From start to finish, just one video takes more than a total of two to three hundred hours to produce by our multi-talented team. So yeah, to have a legitimate online publication like medium.com, just steal our content doesn't feel very good. How did this get past their editors? Are they in on a two? And how lucrative is this business of theft? Let's first take a look into how medium works, starting with their main page. Medium is a home for human stories and ideas. Here, anyone can share knowledge and wisdom with the world without having to build a mailing list or a following first. Anyone? Over 100 million people connect and share their wisdom on medium every month. Wait, what? Here, on this page, using medium, it states, medium is a publishing platform. So it's an ad-free website where you pay a membership fee to join. After that, you can read all of the locked articles and publish your own articles. Anything you want. So it's like YouTube. But for writers. Honestly, we were completely surprised by this revelation. Up until this video with our limited interaction with the website, our team of producers assumed that medium was a traditional media company, an online magazine, where articles had to go through an editorial staff with editorial standards. Now that's not to say all of medium is untrustworthy, but as you know with any social media, when anyone can post anything, facts aren't always their top priority. Genuinely, when you search for something on Google and you click on one of the medium articles, it doesn't show any obvious indication that this is not a traditional publisher. Many of their articles are even behind paywalls like any other media company, such as the New York Times. It's almost as if they want to appear like just another online magazine when they're not. And here's the thing, they're not technically lying. It's all laid out in the about page clear as day, if you make the effort to actually check. But okay, so if this is a YouTube for writers, do writers, like this one stealing our content, make any money off of this. If we dig deeper, there is something called the partner program. One might assume you need a certain standard to be able to join this program, but no. Well, there are three conditions. You need to be a paid member. You have to have a store you've published in the last six months and be located in an eligible country. But that's it. So this harsh job writer took our content and might be making money off of this, on a total of, as of this script, 17 of our videos. Clearly he's a fan. Hi, harsh job. We know you're watching. Since you're probably one of the few people who actually watches every single one of our videos, it's nice to know that you think our writing is good enough to be worth plagiarizing, but please stop stealing our work and passing it off as your own. Thanks. Now, how exactly would he make money from this, you might be wondering? Let's see. On the Medium Partner Program page, it says they take a stand for quality over clickbait. On paper, that sounds like a good thing to strive for, but some of the factors they consider are total views, read time, and reader actions, including claps, their version of the like, highlights, replies, and new follows. Honestly, it sounds very similar to YouTube in a lot of ways, but unlike YouTube, it's paid members only, which essentially means if it's locked, it can potentially earn money for the writer. This is because Medium earns its money through its membership fees. YouTube is free because it earns its money via advertisements. And if we look at the script's harsh job stealing from us, yep, they're locked, and have that member's only story logo on the top. All except for one. That funny enough, we actually have to pay Medium to view our own stolen work, so there's a good possibility he's making money off of our content. It's hard to say how much, that Medium is supposed to be a positive thing. A place where writers can make legitimate money on the side. We know first handout difficult it can be for writers to get to a point where they're earning a living from their craft, and a platform like Medium can be a good place for many writers to get started, but clearly, some bad actors like Harsh Jar are exploiting this system to their advantage, and they can produce content at a much faster rate than a legitimate writer. And also like YouTube, it's kind of hard to make enough money from your content to survive. You never know what's going to go viral in what's not. It's a guessing game, even when you've done it as long as we have. Even now, we constantly have to try our hardest just to break even after production costs. This is why on Medium, every writer seems to make a different amount. Some say they hardly make money, while others say they could make a few thousand, and often it's from an article that goes viral. And what viral means on Medium might be vastly different from YouTube, so there's no way to tell if and how much he's making from our content. Not to mention, it doesn't really show publicly how many people viewed his uploads of our scripts, but there are claps and comments which might give us a clue. One of our stories about the internet sleuths who gave an unidentified woman her identity back 48 years after she was found dead in a park. His copy and pasted article has 109 claps, and someone commented, wow, what an amazing story. The hard work of everyone involved paid off twofold, to which harsh responded with, thank you for your appreciation. And yes, the teamwork and hard work of everyone really reap the results. One of our more tragic stories like Lyle Stevick, the man who died in a motel room after checking in with a fake name and whose real name no one knew until Reddit solved the mystery 17 years later, there's 176 claps, and two comments. This was an amazing breed from a case I'd never heard of. Thank you for writing. Hey, thanks. And hey, look, harsh responded again, thanking him on our behalf, and also directing them to his list of crime documentaries, most of which are pulled from our channel, and the second comment, wow, that is a lot of information. Well done on researching and compiling it. I didn't know this case. Thank you. It took days for us to sit through thousands of Reddit posts and form a cohesive narrative out of all the information. But of course, harsh responded for us again. Thank you very much for your response. These types of comments really motivate me to research similar cases and present them to you all. Yes, well, if by research similar cases, you mean smash that bell to get notified when we upload our next video, and if by present them to you all, you mean copy, paste, submit, then yeah, I guess that's pretty accurate. Our story about the mystery man found behind a Burger King with Amnesia, 70 claps, someone responded with excellent mystery and very intriguing. One thing though, it is indigent. Andy responded with, thank you for your response and pointing out my mistake. Sure, his mistake, certainly not mine, I would never say indignant instead of indigent. I've never mispronounced anything in my life or in downtown Savannah, a facility for the homeless and indignant. So, okay, it's so far a couple of claps and occasional comment. I guess he's not getting too many views, but then there's this one, pinned to the top of his articles about how a teenager solved a 57-year-old cold case, one of our top performing videos this year. And it has, let's see, 1920 claps and 15 comments, hot dang! Great research had well presented, very readable, which is high praise for such a lengthy article. Keep up the good work, a very powerful telling of this tragic story. Thank you for the thoroughly researched, super detailed account. I found it quite a compelling read, had to finish. This retelling was gut-wrenching, it tugged at the heartstrings, good writing. This is one of my favorite essays that I've ever read on medium. I couldn't stop until the end, and I've reread it twice. Well written, sir, very detailed account. DNA detective stories are interesting reads when presented as you have here. Andy gave the same response to most of these. Thank you very much for your response. These type of comments really motivate me to research similar cases and present them to you all. If you have time and love these types of stories, you could read me articles in my crime documentaries list, thank you. This kind of repetition makes me wonder if he's a bot or something, but he does give unique responses to other comments. How come this one did so much better than the others? It's always a shot in the dark, like we know all too well with our own videos. But there's something interesting here in the top left corner here with a logo. Illumination, we curate and disseminate outstanding stories from diverse domains to create synergy. Interesting. This is a publication within medium. It seems this article was chosen to be part of that publication with 280,000 followers, which is not a small number on medium at all, and this publication has a team of about 30 editors. So how did this article, which is clearly a word for word plagiarism of our video, get past those editors? Well, it's clear they saw the article, but you might consider getting someone to read your articles prior to publishing to ensure the names are all spelled correctly to avoid confusion. Actually, I did send my article to the publication and they did edit it. Yet they didn't notice that this was plagiarized. And he even got a second one of ours into illumination. So that's two that got past them. Not only that, but two other of our stories got into crime time. A publication about all things crime, including murder. But this one is run by only one individual and has only two followers. Let's just focus on illumination then. They actually have an entire guide about how they have zero tolerance for plagiarism. They even say, our editors invest their time and effort in fighting against plagiarism. We created a stringent process and rigorous procedures. Editors use several tools to check duplicated content. Well, clearly they didn't check this one, right? But shouldn't medium also be checking for this? In medium's own partner terms, it states, under necessary rights, you may only lock a story, i.e. place it behind medium's paywall, if you have sufficient rights to make commercial use of the content in it, including text, video, and audio elements. Medium may require you to provide documentation proving you own sufficient rights to lock a story. May require. Okay, so how often, if at all, do they require this documentation? Not to say that when they do check it actually works because, I mean, even on their page about plagiarism, it doesn't say anywhere they actively check for this. Which is evident because there seems to be a big problem with plagiarism on medium. And I'm not just talking about us. Our situation is not an isolated incident by any means. Even writers within medium face this problem. Like Roz Warren, a writing coach, editor, and New York Times writer, who has been on the platform for more than five years. She asked the question, does medium have a way to detect plagiarized content, or does it rely entirely on readers to report it? She explained that she was recently plagiarized. Somebody, or some bot, took four of my medium stories and published them word-for-word under their byline. They were up there for a while. They earned the culprit a little money and talks about other members who face the same problem. She explains that it seems as though medium doesn't have any automated way to check for plagiarism, even amongst its members. But many feel medium should do something. It most certainly is possible and it would be easy and lightning fast for them to do. And she's not the only one to talk about this. The question is, why isn't medium doing something about this? It's not like they don't have the resources. After all, they are taking what we can assume is a good chunk of the membership revenue for themselves. User Oceanic 1801 posted this theory on the medium subreddit. Does medium actually encourage plagiarism? He talks about one member who found, as he described it, a new business model. Copy plus paste plus profit. What blows my mind is how long this has been going on. The guy seems to be comfortably making money and medium doesn't seem to care at all. Before we jump to conspiracies about medium actually encouraging plagiarism just to bolster the volume of their content, it's important to note that when plagiarized content gets reported, it gets taken down pretty quickly. That seems to be the general consensus among the members, some saying the takedown happens within a few hours. But the problem is that it seems to be on the readers to report it, like Reddit user Ren Ren 9000 who posted this on the medium subreddit. Thank you all for posting your stories here. It has made it easier for me to check stories for plagiarism. I've caught a few. I've been catching two or three plagiarists per day lately, and they are all reported to medium. So I've uncovered networks of people copying and pasting stuff online, following each other, clapping for each other, and commenting on each other's work. So why is it on the members themselves to find and uncover these networks of plagiarists? And if people are checking, why are video transcripts like hours going undetected? I mean, surely if you put it into a plagiarism check, it should show our video. Right? Hold on, let me check. See, we didn't find any plagiarism. Okay, maybe we try a different plagiarism checker. Let's see, try this one. Yeah, see, 67% plagiarized content. Perfect. And it shows his medium article. Not our video. Let's just put it straight into Google and see what shows up. And there's only his article. In fact, when we try his other articles, the same problem arises. None of our videos ever show up in plagiarism checkers or even on Google. And it's simple to explain why. Plagiarism checkers check subscription content sources, journal articles, academic papers, and billions of websites. But like with search engines, they check text. There's no way for them to check audio, like from videos or podcasts, unless we publish our transcripts online somewhere searchable. Which, you know, kind of makes it the perfect plagiarism crime, when you think about it. Unless someone happens to stumble upon it like our team did, they can easily get away with it. It's on a completely different platform too. We wouldn't have even thought to look. And this crime has become much easier to commit ever since the inclusion of the generate transcript button on every YouTube video. And it should be because it is there for the people who are hard of hearing. And it's important that it stays there. But it's also obviously being misused. So it's no surprise illumination and any members who might have checked miss the plagiarism. Though we would argue that if they just search the title of his article on Google, our video shows up because he's not only still our content, but our titles too. But is it just us he's still in front more? Are we just one of many? He has quite a few articles actually. Over 150 so far. Since we know he's still our titles, let's use those to search first. How about we start with this article? Last thing to ever happen in the universe. Put it into YouTube and yep, there it is. Chris, it's one of their videos. After a messy birth, our universe was a sleepy baby. Woolman Duck filled with swirling clouds of hot hydrogen and helium. The story of creation is a story of this gas and where it will end up. And harsh jaw stole it word for word. Let's do another. This article titled the most controversial problem in philosophy. And yeah, that's a veritacium word for word. It goes on like this. He's stolen from countless others. Nerdwriter one. Chilling scares. History matters. Unseen. Dark Asia with Megan. And on and on and on. Now some of these titles aren't showing up in a search. But it may be because it's common practice for YouTube channels like ours to change the titles of videos if the original marketing doesn't work. But we still managed to find some. Like this article, which is a word for word rendition of this search party video just with a different title. In January, 2024, please stop the man in Porto Torres, Italy. In his bag was over a kilogram of heroin, specifically white heroin. The purest kind that only comes from one place. The region where Thailand, Laos, and Myanmar converge. He stolen over 100 videos from many YouTube creators, including us. And because of a technical advantage where plagiarism checkers can't check audio online, he's potentially making a lot of money from this. Or he hopes to at least. But is it just this one thief that discovered this new form of plagiarism or are there more? Here's where things get a bit tricky. Where do we even start? For us to uncover YouTube videos being stolen, we can't just select suspicious media articles because as we've explained, copy pasting that text doesn't search for audio. We'll need to do the reverse. Individually choose videos, generate their transcripts, and see if we find a hit on Google. Which we did, and it wasn't an easy task. With the sheer volume of YouTube videos, there's more misses than hits. But eventually, we did get hits. Plenty of them. Like Lemino's video, The Great Silence, which was stolen by media member Ka, or Ka. In 1967, a post-graduate student at Cambridge University by the name of Joslyn Bernel was surveying the sky with a newly constructed radio telescope. While the author doesn't seem to be active anymore, the view articles they do have look familiar. In fact, all five articles are plagiarized from Lemino. Like our number one fan, Harsh Ja, Ka, just calling that for now, didn't bother changing the titles either. Real life lore's video, the ocean is way deeper than you think, showed up with two hits actually. A member who goes just by Anita, who is still active, has this plagiarized article as her first from early September 2025. But her other articles don't give off any red flags that make them look plagiarized. Doing a search for their content shows up nothing. It doesn't mean they aren't plagiarized, though. It's of course possible they're AI, but we have no proof of that. And AI checkers aren't reliable, unfortunately. Then there's a Yosh Moria, who has to be the bravest of them all. He has a profile picture, which could be him, and not only did he steal the title, but even the thumbnail of Real Life Lore's video, as well as Chris Casatt, and economics explained. However, it seems like while he stole all of their thumbnails, which in itself is theft, he didn't plagiarize all of them. At least not in the way we think of plagiarism. For the Real Life Lore video, and the two he stole from economics explained, he plagiarized it word for word. But for the rest, he clearly took an AI summary of the video, and used that instead. Not too far down, at 1.8 meters, and we arrive at the standard grave depth in Western culture. So if you are afraid of zombies, this is how far down they'll be coming from. Four meters down, and we arrive at the depth that Faro Tutankomans' tomb was discovered at. A little further at six meters below the surface, we've reached the maximum depth that metal detectors can pick up signals from. Up to now, we've been talking about what's known as verbatim plagiarism. While AI is a whole other degree of bad writing practice, when we're very much against, this is clearly summarized. That in itself is known as paraphrasing plagiarism. Even if the words are completely changed, he just did it in the laziest way possible. Then there's something called mosaic plagiarism, which some writers don't even know as a form of plagiarism. It's when you take the words of one work, and you alter them slightly. Maybe adding some words, rearranging them, or changing a word or two, even combining it with words from another author, and assuming that's enough, but it's not. Usually it's a sentence here, a sentence there, but the medium member Ayusha Vaish, who has 220 followers, takes mosaic plagiarism to an extreme. When she stole yet another one of Kurskazat's videos, The Fermi Paradox, where are all the aliens? She titled it with a slight variation, Fermi Paradox. Where is everyone? Are we the only living things in the entire universe? The observable universe is about 90 billion light years in diameter. There are at least 100 billion galaxies, each with 100 to 1000 billion stars. Recently, we've learned that planets are very common too, and there are probably trillions and trillions of habitable planets in the universe, which means there should be lots of opportunity for life to develop and exist, right? But where is it? One of her articles isn't mosaic at all, but verbatim from Dr. Larissa Burasava, an astronomer who posted to a discussion on research gate. Perhaps this medium member felt it was obscure enough that people wouldn't detect it, and another one stolen from a blog. So it seems these have gotten past medium as well, despite being copied from text on the web and easy to search for. Another member Sophia Taylor has 221 followers, and her articles are full of YouTube content, like this one about food, which is the Ted Ed video of the same name. She's stolen from other channels more focused on medicine, like Cleveland Clinic, and GoodRx, and that last one is actually kind of funny because it's in the first person, so like she says, when we do prescribe these medications, and I don't know, I don't think she said she's a doctor in her profile, but it just keeps going, and going, and going, and going, and it's not limited to medium either. Plagiarism has been a problem on the internet, even before the internet. It's why copyright rules exist in the first place, and we have our share of copyright issues of channels on YouTube stealing videos, and then of course there's the questionable reaction videos. But this seems to be something new, taking advantage of the AI technology that is used for people who are hard of hearing, and instead using it for their own malicious purposes, publishing entire videos as articles and getting away with it because of a technical limitation, the perfect plagiarism crime. So what can we do about it? We don't think medium is a terrible place, but not at all. It's a great place for actual writers to start their career and provides a platform to voice a variety of opinions and thoughts in a world where many traditional media outlets show increasing bias. Like any platform, the legitimacy, and trust depends on the individual author. But we do need to pressure medium to be more strict about plagiarism in general, to actually implement some sort of plagiarism check. But until they do, it may be on all creators, be it writers, YouTubers, or podcasters, to find these plagiarists themselves. A quick copy paste of your work into Google to see if it's somewhere out there being stolen. As of this video being released, we've sent out an email to inform medium of all these plagiarists, including the work stolen from other content creators. So hopefully they'll have taken them down by the time you're watching this. However, we do have them archived, and you can see them all linked in our sources in the description if you're curious. But like most creators, we can't do this all the time. It's a big task when we're already spending all of our time focused on trying to produce enough quality content to stay afloat. Which is exactly why we sometimes need multiple brews. Oh, hey, we're ramping things up just to survive, especially when we only keep about half of the ad revenue from our YouTube videos, which is why many creators rely on support from fans through paid subscriptions like Patreon or the YouTube membership program. While we wholeheartedly appreciate those who support us through channel memberships, the platform also takes a cut here, about a third of the revenue, and Patreon isn't much better. But recently, we did find something much better. That's why we're happy to announce the launch of our new stacked paid membership. Stacked is a new platform similar to Patreon, except stack takes less than half the amount Patreon does, allowing creators to keep 95% of their donations. If you want to support us, help us continue to elevate our production quality and receive cool perks in return. It's the price of a cup of coffee. Nothing will change with our YouTube content, but if you join us on stack.com slash brew, you'll get new ways to enjoy brew. For $5 a month, stacked members get access to behind-the-scenes production discussions, ad-free and sponsor-free versions of our YouTube videos, and non-algorithm-friendly bonus videos that we wouldn't be able to make for YouTube in the first place. Oh, and you'll also get discounts on merch? Yes, merch is coming. Don't worry, we want it being plushy as much as you do. You can join now by going to stack.com slash brew, or clicking the link in the description below. Thanks to all of you who've watched all the way to the end, and to those who've hit the like button and subscribe to our channel, your support makes it possible for this channel to keep going. See you in the next one.",
